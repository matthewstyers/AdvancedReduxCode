# AdvancedReduxCode

Code repository for an awesome course on React and Redux.  See [here](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial)


# About this fork
The basic idea is to maintain lecture-by-lecture code branches. Branch naming convention is straightforward – [section].[lecture]-[lecture-title]. Note that naming convention does not use Udemy lecture number, mostly because we can't certain it won't change, in which case all this is worthless.

# How To Use
1. fork this fork so you can do your own version control. Good source code management is a habit; practice makes perfect.
2. Follow the below instructions as you work your way through the course.
3. (optional) use Sourcetree to do your checkouts. Why? Because even if you're a git god, sometimes a visual of your repo is nice when you're dealing with a billion branches you didn't make.

Each branch contains the **completed** code for that lecture, so:
- to see the completed code (or get a diff against a bug you're currently having), `checkout` the current lecture's branch.
- to jump to the code for the beginning of a lecture, `checkout` the previous lecture's branch.
